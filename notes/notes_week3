Looping- for loop “definite loop”
for variable in sequence:
(body)
Sequence needs to be a list [1,2,3]

For element in [1,2,3]
Print(element)
1
2
3

For element in range(10):
If you want numbers to be listed horizontally, end the print(element command with ,end=” “)

When you have nested loops,
the code goes through all in the range of the inside first

primitive data types (building blocks for all data in the computer)
-"hello, world!" = a string
- 3 = int/integer -/+ whole
- 3.0 = float/floating point number, a decimal

classes consist of data and functions.
a way for us to group data together
new data types
-range
-class

/ - floating point division
// - integer division
% - remainder or mod (can tell even and odd)

% even/odd (repeating numbers)
abs(-10) = 10
 anything in parentheses are called parameters/arguments

 range(start, stop, step)
 start is included in final
 stop is not included
 step is what it counts by

# accumulator pattern
sum = 0
for i in range(101):
    sum = sum + i
 print(sum)

The int() function takes floats and turns them into integers

round(float, number of decimal places to round to)
round returns floats
